Ensure this account is trusted by the SQL Server. When using Windows authentication to connect to a SQL Server, and that SQL server is in a different domain to the Spotlight Diagnostic Server, the domain the SQL Server is in must trust the domain the Spotlight Diagnostic Server is in.\nAlternatively, fill in the Database User and Password fields.

The host is identified in the Connection section of the Connection Details page.\n The alarms template option is applicable only when creating a new SQL Server connection. To apply a template to an existing SQL Server connection, see [Configuration Templates][enterprise_cfgmonitor_templates].\n Troubleshooting Connection to the Windows host Verify the SQL Server host is in a domain. Spotlight cannot monitor a SQL Server database when the Windows host is in a workgroup.\nIf the SQL Server is hosted within Microsoft Cluster Server (MSCS) then ensure the Windows Server host is selected as Cluster (monitor active node). Spotlight uses the current host node name to select the operating system connection. Therefore each Windows node in the cluster must be monitored by Spotlight. Verify each Windows node is in the list of Windows server connections.\nThe Spotlight Diagnostic Server uses WMI queries to retrieve performance counter information from the Windows server host. Verify WMI is working and returns data properly.\nVerify TCP port 135 is open on the Windows server host.\nConnection to the SQL Server instance If Spotlight cannot connect to the SQL Server instance then use another tool such as Microsoft\u0026rsquo;s SQL Server Management Studio or sqlcmd to connect to the SQL Server instance. Is the issue with Spotlight\u0026rsquo;s ability to connect to the SQL Server instance or with any any/every tool\u0026rsquo;s ability to connect to the SQL Server instance?\nEnsure ports are open as outlined in the Microsoft KBase article that describes SQL Server firewall connectivity issues: http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc646023.aspx.\nIf Spotlight cannot connect to the SQL Server instance you may need to upgrade Microsoft Data Access Components (MDAC) on the Spotlight Client host AND the Spotlight Diagnostic Server host.

A database with healthy performance spends its time productively - on CPU and I/O.\nA database with unhealthy performance often spends too much time waiting for bottlenecks such as locks and latches.\nBy analyzing the waits of a SQL Server instance Spotlight can determine the relative proportion of time the instance spends on CPU, I/O, locks and latches. As long as a database instance devotes enough time to CPU and I/O, it will be considered healthy.\nAdditionally, the single-block-read latency of the database instance is taken into consideration. This needs to be low/fast enough to indicate that the time being spent on I/O is productive.\nHowever, if the time spent on waits is significantly lower than the available CPU time on the Windows host, there is not enough load being placed on the database instance to assess its health.\nIn summary: if a database instance devotes most of its time to CPU and I/O and has a low single-block read latency, it will obtain a performance-health rating of 80% or more, which is considered healthy.\n"

If you attempt to stop Spotlight whilst a program or command line action is still executing, Spotlight will wait until that program or command line action has ended before stopping.  Run actions again after Re-evaluate this rule after a specified period of time. If the conditions of this rule are still true at that time then repeat the actions. Continue to repeat these actions at this interval for as long as all conditions are true.\nYou define the period of time: in hours, minutes or days.\nFor example, if the rule is to Send an email if a CPU alarm is raised and Run actions again after 5 minutes, then an email will be sent every 5 minutes for as long as the CPU alarm is raised.\nSend Push Notification to my mobile device Send a push notification to mobile device(s) where Spotlight Mobile is installed with Sign in from the Spotlight Cloud (Spotlight Essentials) account(s) entered into the To field.\nTo The Spotlight Cloud (Spotlight Essentials) account name(s) to receive the push notification.\nNote that Spotlight Cloud account names are in the form of an email address. However the push notification is not sent to the email address. The push notification is sent to mobile device(s) where Spotlight Mobile is installed with Sign in from this(these) Spotlight Cloud account name(s).\nWhen multiple Spotlight Cloud account names are involved, separate each account name with a comma.\nMessage The push notification message. This can include variables. For more information, see [Alarms - Message Variables][enterprise_cfgmonitor_alarm_messagevariables].\nFor more information on the receipt of these push notifications, refer to the [Spotlight Mobile Guide][mobile_alarm_notifications].\nSend email to Send an email. Enter the target email address, subject line and content of the message to be sent. For more information, see [Send email to\u0026hellip;.][enterprise_cfgmonitor_alarmaction_sendemail]\nYou can create a default recipient list. For more information, see [Configure the Diagnostic Server\u0026rsquo;s mail server][enterprise_cfgds_mailserver].\nTo include text specific to the alarm in the email use variables. See [Alarms - Message Variables][enterprise_cfgmonitor_alarm_messagevariables].\nSend PagerDuty incident Send the details of this alarm to PagerDuty; PagerDuty can then be used to notify the appropriate people via SMS, email, phone calls and push notifications. Spotlight sends the following alarm details: the alarm name, connection name, the time the alarm was raised, the severity of the alarm, the alarm message and snooze status. Ensure the necessary instructions have been followed to integrate Spotlight with PagerDuty:\n [Configure PagerDuty][enterprise_cfgds_pagerduty] [PagerDuty][enterprise_interface_pagerduty] www.pagerduty.com/docs  Send SNMP Trap Generate an SNMP trap. The trap will be sent to the SNMP manager as configured on the page [Configure the SNMP Trap][enterprise_cfgds_snmptrap]. The SNMP trap can be viewed through third party software designed for that purpose. The trap contains the alarm name, time of the alarm, severity, Spotlight alarm message and connection name.\nStop processing further rules No further rules will be executed. Execute this rule to completion first. For more information, see Example [Alarm Action Rules][enterprise_cfgmonitor_alarmactions].\nSuppress the alarm Return the alarm severity to {% include inline_imageClient.html file=\u0026ldquo;icon_alarm_green.png\u0026rdquo; alt=\u0026ldquo;Normal\u0026rdquo; %} Normal.\nIf the alarm requires acknowledgment and has not been acknowledged, then following this action the alarm severity will be returned to normal without acknowledgment.\nWrite the alarm details to a Windows Event log Write the details of the alarm to the Windows Event log on the Spotlight Diagnostic Server.\nSource Source is the name of the software that logs the event.\nIf you change the source name, make sure you do not change it to an existing system\u0026rsquo;s source name.\nLevel Level is one of: Success, Error, Warning, Information.\nMessage The message field is required; it cannot be empty.
